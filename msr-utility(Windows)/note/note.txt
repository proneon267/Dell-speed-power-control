
C-State 	Description 			Function
C0 		Operating 			CPU fully turned on
C1 		Halt State 			Stops CPU main internal clocks through software
C1E 		Enhanced Halt 			Similar to C1, additionally reduces CPU voltage
C2 		Stop Grant 			Stops CPU internal and external clocks through hardware
C2E 		Extended Stop Grant 		Similar to C2, additionally reduces CPU voltage
C3 		Deep Sleep 			Stops all CPU internal and external clocks
C3E 		Extended Stop Grant 		Similar to C3, additionally reduces CPU voltage
C4 		Deeper Sleep 			Reduces CPU voltage
C4E 		Enhanced Deeper Sleep 		Reduces CPU voltage even more and turns off the memory cache
C6 		Deep Power Down 		Reduces the CPU internal voltage to any value, including 0V
C7 		Deep Power Down 		Similar to C6, additionally LLC (LastLevelCache) is switched off
